# design-patterns
Python adaptation of the Head First Design Patterns book by Freeman, Robson, Bates and Sierra.
To make each module self-contained, we have repeated some code.

## Summary of the design principles
The parenthesis identify the chapter on which the principle was first applied, i.e (1) = chapter 1.

1. (1) Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same - i.e, *encapsulate what varies*;
2. (1) *Program to an interface, not an implementation*;
3. (1) *Favor composition over inheritance*;
4. (2) *Strive for loosely coupled designs* between objects which can interact;
