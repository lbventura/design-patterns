*How does the Hollywood principle related to the Dependency Inversion Principle?* 

Dependency inversion teaches us to avoid the use of concrete classes and instead work with abstractions. The Hollywood principle is a technique for building frameworks or components so that lower-level components can be hooked into the computation without creating dependencies between the lower-level components and the higher-level layers. 

While the DIP makes a general statement on how to avoid dependencies in design, the HP gives a technique for creating designs which allow lower-level structures to interoperate while preventing other classes from becoming too dependent on them.
